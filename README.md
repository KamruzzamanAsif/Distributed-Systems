# About This Version
> this is the final version of our system.

* This version only contains a docker-compose.yml file.
* Inside this the sevices are defined properly.
* Our previous services are  uploaded into docer hub and have been used here.
* So now we don't need any local code here. Docker will fetch the service images from docker hub directly.

# Usages

> run the command </br> `docker-compose up -d --build`

> This will take some minuites to fetch the images from docker hub and will run them. Later you are ready to use our system through  browser `loaclhost`.
